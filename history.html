            <h2>My Journey So Far</h2>
            <p>I have a passion for football, and I enjoy playing whenever I get the chance. Football helps me stay active and refreshed.</p>

            <p>During my career, I've gained valuable experience working in call center companies. This experience has helped me develop strong soft skills, enabling me to effectively communicate with others and solve problems with innovative solutions.</p>
            <p>Currently, I work as an interpreter and have been focusing on improving my German language skills. I have reached a good level of proficiency in German through consistent practice and dedication.</p>
            <p>I embarked on my programming journey with the CS50 course offered by Harvard University. This comprehensive course covers everything from basic concepts to advanced programming languages like Python. You can learn more about the course <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/">here</a>.</p>
            <p>Since then, I have been working on various personal projects to further enhance my skills and explore new technologies.</p>
